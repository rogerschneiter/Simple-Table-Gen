# Simple-Table-Gen

This software is used to create tables in a JavaFX UI. It can be used to export tables as HTML Code, SQLite or MySQL Script. You can either create the tables structure only or, if needed, insert data and export this aswell. It supports Primary Keys and Foreign Keys. Further enhancements are in work.
